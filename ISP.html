	<h1>ISPs: AT&T</h1>

<div class="division2">
	<p>AT&T is a cell phone service provider that doubles as an Internet service provider, or an ISP. According to <a href="https://www.att.com/internet/fiber/">AT&T</a>, they offer various services including three devices on one AT&T network, devices that can function 150 feet away from the router and their fastest internet that can download 1 gigabit per second. <br>There are many pros to choosing AT&T, but, just like any ISP, there are also some cons. According to <a href="https://www.whistleout.com/CellPhones/Guides/att-cell-phone-plans-pros-and-cons">WhistleOut</a>, some of these pros include very wide and reliable coverage. Over the past few years, AT&T has almost always had the second or third best coverage out of the major services in the United States. Consistency is very important for a cell phone service provider and for an ISP and AT&T is very consistent. Another perk is their international plans. Being able to communicate with and send information to other countries is very important for any provider and AT&T’s plans are stellar. They have two different plans that give access to over 120 countries worldwide. <br>While there are lots of great aspects of AT&T, here are some cons along with them. The plans are very expensive and the amount of data you can use per month before it slows down is very low. The hotspot’s are also not great so people who rely on their phones a lot might not want to choose this plan.
