    <p>The internet is being used for <b>countless</b> purposes on <b>infinite</b> websites and apps, by billions of people worldwide. For many reasons, 86% of internet users have made <b>at least</b> some kind of attempt to make themselves somewhat anonymous when they are online. Anonymity, in the sense of online users, is “any <b>interaction</b> a user has on the Internet that <b>protects</b> his or her identity from being <b>shared</b> with another user or with a <b>third party</b>.” Depending on the <b>intentions</b> of the anonymous user and the <b>reason</b> they want to stay anonymous, this tool can be incredibly<b>helpful</b> and incredibly <b>harmful</b> depending on how it is used. From organizing protests and becoming part of an <b>online community</b> to cyberbullying and scams, these pages will <b>highlight</b> the main <b>pros</b> and <b>cons</b> of online anonymity.</p> <br>

  <!--We used a video to help introduce the concept of anonymity because we wanted to add different types of information, not just text, but also a variety of media. It is also quite short and only briefly covers it because it is jusr a neutral overview before readers strat to look at the pages for each side.-->
