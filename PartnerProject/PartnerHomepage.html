    <p>The internet is being used for countless purposes on infinite websites and apps, by billions of people worldwide. For many reasons, 86% of internet users have made at least some kind of attempt to make themselves somewhat anonymous when they are online. Anonymity, in the sense of online users, is “any interaction a user has on the Internet that protects his or her identity from being shared with another user or with a third party.” Depending on the intentions of the anonymous user and the reason they want to stay anonymous, this tool can be incredibly helpful and incredibly harmful depending on how it is used. From organizing protests and becoming part of an online community to cyberbullying and scams, these pages will highlight the main pros and cons of online anonymity.</p>
