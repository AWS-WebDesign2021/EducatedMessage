        <p>While anonymity does have benefits, there are many disadvantages to go with them. One of these includes cyberbullying, because when people are anonymous they not only say things they would never say in person, but it is also harder for them to be identified. In line with this, there are countless examples of how anonymity promotes actions without consequences, whether that means teaching little kids what they do on the internet doesn’t matter, or people breaking the law online simply because they don’t think they will be caught. Even if one particular instance isn’t serious, the lesson it teaches and the ideas it imprints on growing and grown minds IS serious and is permanently harmful. Another con of anonymity is that very little on the internet is trustworthy and a lot of information is incorrect or has a specific agenda. Even if information is correct and unbiased, most people don’t trust it due to the large amount that isn’t. Because of this and because of the ill intentions of many internet users sometimes due to anonymity and the freedom it brings, 80% of users think their data is vulnerable to hackers and feel unsafe. You never really know who you are talking to on the internet even if they seem trustworthy and this sad reality has been accepted in society for years. </p>
