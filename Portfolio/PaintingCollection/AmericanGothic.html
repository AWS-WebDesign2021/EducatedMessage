			<p>American Gothic was painted by Grant Wood in 1930. It shot Grant Wood to fame and won a $300 prize at the Art Institute of Chicago. It is based in Eldon, Iowa, where Wood saw a farmhouse and based the subjects off of his sister and his dentist because he wanted the style to be Carpenter Gothic. Currently, American Gothic is at the Royal Academy of Arts.</p>

<!--I actually took screenshots of these pictures, changed their name, put them in the "Painting Collection" folder and then uploaded them here to make it an easier process. Although, I did use the original links in my work cited to make sure to give credit to their owner.-->
