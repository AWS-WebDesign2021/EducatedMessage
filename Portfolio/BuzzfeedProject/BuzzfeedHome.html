      This was our most recent project and this is definitely one of my favorite projects. We had so much creative liberty and I chose Marvel trivia, so because I really enjoyed the topic I was coding about, I didn’t mind putting in more time and effort to make it perfect. Although, this project didn’t come without its challenges. It was our first project using Javascript, which definitely made crafting my “results'' a lot harder. One of the problems I had with my results was creating the “level” aspect, where I told viewers how good they were at Marvel trivia depending on their score. Not only did I have some syntax issues, but I also had some very complex placement issues. I also had a lot of trouble getting my results to even show up. The time I took to figure these out was worth it though, because the next time I had a problem with my Javascript, I could fix it very quickly.
