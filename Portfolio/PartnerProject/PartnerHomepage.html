    <p2><b>Background</b></p2>
    <p>The internet is being used for countless purposes on infinite websites and apps,
      by billions of people worldwide. For <br> many reasons, 86% of internet users have
      made at least some kind of attempt to make themselves somewhat anonymous<br> when
      they are online. Anonymity, in the sense of online users, is “any interaction
      a user has on the Internet that protects <br> his or her identity from being
      shared with another user or with a third party.” Depending on the intentions
      of the <br>anonymous user and the reason they want to stay anonymous, this tool
      can be incredibly helpful and incredibly harmful <br>depending on how it is used.
      From organizing protests and becoming part of an online community to cyberbullying
      and <br>scams, these pages will highlight the main pros and cons of online anonymity.</p>

<!--We used a video to help introduce the concept of anonymity because we wanted to add different types of information, not just text, but also a variety of media. It is also quite short and only briefly covers it because it is jusr a neutral overview before readers start to look at the pages for each side.-->

  This was my first and only time making a webpage with a partner. The topic was Social and Ethical Issues of IT, and my partner, Sofia, and I chose anonymity. While working with Sofia was really fun and having another person’s experience, style and perspective was super helpful, it was a little bit harder because we had to upload new versions and switch computers and coordinate edit times, which I had never dealt with before. I also think that because we had different styles, trying to communicate what we wanted and compromise was a little clumsy. In the end, I learned a lot about communication and about coding, thanks to Sofia, but I was definitely a bit burnt out by the end. One specific problem I had was that my hyperlinks were purple because I had already clicked on them and my background was also purple, so I spent over an hour trying to figure out why my links aren't showing up, just to find out that everything was fine and they just happened to blend in with my background.
