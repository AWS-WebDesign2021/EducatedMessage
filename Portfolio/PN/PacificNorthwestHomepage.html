      This was our first webpage with a stylesheet and a complex css feature. I also used pixels to place my text and images for the first time. The complex css feature I chose was a dropdown menu, which I had never done before. I had a lot of trouble with the dropdown menu because of the placements, mixing up of divs, keeping track of every webpage, and, of course, actually making the dropdown work! It took a lot of work, but I was incredibly happy with my final dropdown, and I used this skill for almost every webpage I made after this project. I had a lot of fun very slowly getting the perfect placement for everything in my webpages, even though it was very time consuming. Using different colors and trying to match up the color palettes of webpages to give a professional look was really rewarding as well.
