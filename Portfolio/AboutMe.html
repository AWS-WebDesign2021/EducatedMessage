I have been at Annie Wright for 9 years and I <b>still</b> get lost most days. <br>I'm not quite sure what I want to be when I grow up. Although, I am a pretty creative and adventurous person and I have some ideas. I am excited to figure out what I want to do with my future.</br></p>

<p>I have a 6 year old dog named Roger. He is <b>very</b> lazy but adorable and sweet too. <br>He <b>loves</b> to make me throw his ball and squeaky toys and to go on long walks. He also loves to gaze out the window and scream at any people who dare walk by our house. </br> Here is a picture of him.</p>

<p>My <b>favorite</b> Youtube videos are cake decorating videos. I am <b>horrible</b> at baking, but that's okay because these cakes look <b>beautiful</b> and make me really hungry without all of the work to actually make it.</p>

	<p>This project was one of our first real webpages, and the first one that I actually built. Some of the requirements were proper html structure, to organize information into different sections with the correct tags, to use lists, to have line breaks, to use at least one image and one small video and to use citations if needed. I had some issues with adding an image, but after tinkering with that and eventually asking for help, it helped me for many of my future webpages. I was also able to new things that I couldn't have built if I hadn't come across this issue. It was also fun to make this webpage specifically about myself and my interests. </p>
