<!--I used the same basic format for all my paragraphs to make sure they flowed and make sure I didn't forget any important information. My format is: #1. Introduce the painting, it's maker, when it was made and where it was made. #2. Discuss an important fact or what makes it unique. #3. End with where the painting currently is.-->
			<p>The Last Supper was painted by Leonardo da Vinci sometime between 1495 and 1498 in Milan. It shows a scene from the Bible, were Jesus tells his followers that one of them will betray him and each Apostle is reacting in painting how da Vinci thought they would have reacted. Currently, The Last Supper is in the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan. </p>
