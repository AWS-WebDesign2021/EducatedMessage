<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I like how nice everyone at Annie Wright is, especially in Upper School. I am also 
<b>really</b> glad to be in person because I learn better and I also get to see my friends! I have been at Annie Wright for 9 years and I <b>still</b> get lost most days. <br>I'm not quite sure what I want to be when I grow up. Although, I am a pretty creative and adventurous person and I have some ideas. I am excited to figure out what I want to do with my future.</br></p>

<p>I have a 6 year old dog named Roger. He is <b>very</b> lazy but adorable and sweet too. <br>He <b>loves</b> to make me throw his ball and squeaky toys and to go on long walks. He also loves to gaze out the window and scream at any people who dare walk by our house. </br> Here is a picture of him.</p>

<p>My <b>favorite</b> Youtube videos are cake decorating videos. I am <b>horrible</b> at baking, but that's okay because these cakes look <b>beautiful</b> and make me really hungry without all of the work to actually make it.</p>
